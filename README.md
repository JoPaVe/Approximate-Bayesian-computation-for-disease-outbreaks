# Approximate-Bayesian-computation-for-disease-outbreaks

Let's try to use four files:
1. ABC_algorithm.R -> Used for code of ABC SMC for model selection on the joint space
2. Tests.R -> Write every test that you make as function here - She wants to see the tests that we are running, can gather it here and adjust/correct later
3. DataLoading.R -> Used for DataLoading
4. Plotting.R -> Used to create Plots
5. Main.R -> Running of all code and description (maybe not needed)

Everyone should work in their own branch and commit after their work is done. 
Comment frequently and comment on code of others with #!# or #?#, accordingly.
